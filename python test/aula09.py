print("""The moon rises in the silent night,
A silver glow, so soft and bright.
It whispers secrets to the sea,
In waves that dance so endlessly.

A lonely traveler in the sky,
Watching worlds as time drifts by.
It changes shape, yet stays the same,
A mystic light, a golden flame.

Through darkest nights, it softly glows,
A gentle guide when lost one goes.
It sings to stars in silver streams,
A silent keeper of our dreams.

Oh, moon so high, so cold, so bright,
A beacon in the endless night.""")
